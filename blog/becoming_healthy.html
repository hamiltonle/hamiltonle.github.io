	------------------My Systems for Weightless


	Caloric Deficit
	The one tactic that lead to my major weightloss was definitely the "calorie in, calorie out" principle.  Taking a TDE, my recommended daily calories at the time was 2300.  The health community says 1200 calories for males is the absolute minimum, while the MyFitnessPal app doesn't even allow you to finish a day's food log totaling anything less than 1500 calories.

	With this in mind, I used 1800 calories to start with and continually lower the caloric minimum in accordance with my TDE.

	Calorie Counting
	Like many people I spoke to before getting my food scale, I thought that the idea of weighing every ingredient and tracking every gram or calorie was absurdly tedious.  Looking back though, it's obvious that it should be the only way people can track their progress in a transparent, honest, and effective manner.  

	We've all grown up in such a world of shortcuts and sensational stories that people who follow psuedoscience's loose and ill-guided principles on a daily basis can't be blamed for hoping to achieve the same results.  

	What tracking progress provides is a consistent and concrete assurance that each miniscule action is a win in and of itself.  Each progressive number on the scale or each notch of the belt can be attributed to the precise number of calories withheld from your diet.

	A scale doesn't limit your diet, but rather frees you from your inner struggles.  We've all tried dieting without a scale and while it may work well for a few initial days, once you're ungrounded motivation begins to wane, you begin to fight with yourself over every serving of food you percieve as too much; your angel and devil constantly bickering over an extra slice of pizza.  Changing one's diet is hard enough, let alone stressing over the pros and cons of another fry, only to feel defeated either way.  

	A food scale frees you from this self-defeating cycle.  Rather than believing an extra large coke is totally out of the question, you can just easily refer to your day's current calorie count and determine whether you have room for it or now.  If so, enjoy it without guilt.  If not, then at least you have a solid reason to tell your chubby devil why not.



	Eating before you're hungry
	We've heard the saying that "if you're thirsty, you're already dehydrated."  I applied this same concept to food as well.  Whether or not there's actual bodily harm in this concept, the mental benefits are plentiful.
	1) First off, being hungry is just uncomfortable.
	2) Most importantly, you make wiser decisions when you're not hungry

	Bonus points
	1) If you're cost-coscience, then eating during non-peak is great for saving money
	2) If you're time-conscience, there are very little to no wait during non-rush hours.


	Eat like a king for breakfast, a prince for lunch, and a pauper for dinner
	I had skipped breakfast for most of my life, until at age 19 when a 7am breakfast was mandatory at a summer camp I worked at.  I never had more energy.  
	The health community seems to be have many schools of thought on number of meals per day, contents of each meal, intermittent fasting, etc.  For me, being someone who was raised to feel full after every meal, it was extremely hard to feel satisfied otherwise.  Eventually I stopped waiting for a sign from my stomach indicating it couldn't hold more food, and instead, actively monitored my stomach for signs that it had shut up already about being empty.

	Nevertheless, our animalistic sense has evolved to tell us that a full stomach equates to energy security, so psycholically, I do allow myself to feel full at least once a day in the morning.  For evenings where I've already met my caloric  intake, I distract myself with something more engaging than food, such as a movie or programming.


	Taking food away to give to the poor
	If you were raised with asian parents, you likely were forced to clean every last bit of your plate.  The reason being you had the privilege of having too much to eat while others did not.  And while you can control your portions at home, you don't have this luxury when eating out.  I initially felt guilty leaving food on the plate, but found a solution which aligned with my parents train of thought; I started always asking for take-away boxes to eventually give to a deserving begger or homeless family. (I understand this opens a large discussion about helping/hurting homelessness with short-term charity, but that's for another time).


	Low-carbs
	My body responds to carbs in a peculiar way.  Morning carbs give me great start to the day while lunchtime carbs make me sleepy.  I hate being unproductive, so I nicked it from my diet.


	Eating the same 2-4 meals
	Feel free to add more meals to your diet, but the main point here is that every meal doesn't need to be unique, taste amazing, and require hours of planning.  Eat clean and healthy for 90% of your meals and you'll appreciate that 10% of meals much more.  In addition, you'll have much more time on your hands that would've otherwise been spent debating between ramen or mexican.  Have a few meals which you know every calorie and nutritional aspect of, and systematically rotate it through your schedule.




	Keeping unhealthy foods out of the pantry/kitchen
	Those who successfully quit smoking didn't sabotagve themselves by placing cigarettes a few feet from nicotine patches.


	Reddit community
	I wasn't so vocal in an online forum or community, but it was a great resource for when I had questions, or if I just needed to hear someone else's experience with a particular situation.

	Not telling anyone
	As [ted talk guy] researched and said, don't give yourself the hollow satisfaction of telling people your goal.  Trust me, months later, their "oh wow, you've lost weight" or "you're looking great" will feel much more gratifying.


	Stay in close touch with people who already went through the transformation:
	It's important to have people close to you remind you that it wasn't an overnight achievement.  I was lucky enough to have that person be my wife.

	Take before pictures!
	I didn't do this, and had to scour my facebook page for bad photos (which is fun as well.  you should do this too).  Take those before pictures and vow to never be that person again.</p>
